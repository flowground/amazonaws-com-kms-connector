    "description": "AWS Key Management Service AWS Key Management Service (AWS KMS) is an encryption\nand key management web service. This guide describes the AWS KMS operations that\nyou can call programmatically. For general information about AWS KMS, see the \nAWS Key Management Service Developer Guide\n[http://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/].\n\nAWS provides SDKs that consist of libraries and sample code for various\nprogramming languages and platforms (Java, Ruby, .Net, macOS, Android, etc.).\nThe SDKs provide a convenient way to create programmatic access to AWS KMS and\nother AWS services. For example, the SDKs take care of tasks such as signing\nrequests (see below), managing errors, and retrying requests automatically. For\nmore information about the AWS SDKs, including how to download and install them,\nsee Tools for Amazon Web Services [http://aws.amazon.com/tools/].\n\nWe recommend that you use the AWS SDKs to make programmatic API calls to AWS\nKMS.\n\nClients must support TLS (Transport Layer Security) 1.0. We recommend TLS 1.2.\nClients must also support cipher suites with Perfect Forward Secrecy (PFS) such\nas Ephemeral Diffie-Hellman (DHE) or Elliptic Curve Ephemeral Diffie-Hellman\n(ECDHE). Most modern systems such as Java 7 and later support these modes.\n\n Signing Requests \n\nRequests must be signed by using an access key ID and a secret access key. We\nstrongly recommend that you do not use your AWS account (root) access key ID and\nsecret key for everyday work with AWS KMS. Instead, use the access key ID and\nsecret access key for an IAM user, or you can use the AWS Security Token Service\nto generate temporary security credentials that you can use to sign requests.\n\nAll AWS KMS operations require Signature Version 4\n[http://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/signature-version-4.html].\n\n Logging API Requests \n\nAWS KMS supports AWS CloudTrail, a service that logs AWS API calls and related\nevents for your AWS account and delivers them to an Amazon S3 bucket that you\nspecify. By using the information collected by CloudTrail, you can determine\nwhat requests were made to AWS KMS, who made the request, when it was made, and\nso on. To learn more about CloudTrail, including how to turn it on and find your\nlog files, see the AWS CloudTrail User Guide\n[http://docs.aws.amazon.com/awscloudtrail/latest/userguide/].\n\n Additional Resources \n\nFor more information about credentials and request signing, see the following:\n\n *   AWS Security Credentials\n   [http://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/aws-security-credentials.html] \n   - This topic provides general information about the of credentials used for\n   accessing AWS.\n   \n   \n *   Temporary Security Credentials\n   [http://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_credentials_temp.html] -\n   This section of the IAM User Guide describes how to create and use temporary\n   security credentials.\n   \n   \n *   Signature Version 4 Signing Process\n   [http://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/signature-version-4.html] -\n   This set of topics walks you through the process of signing a request using\n   an access key ID and a secret access key.\n   \n   \n\n Commonly Used APIs \n\nOf the APIs discussed in this guide, the following will prove the most useful\nfor most applications. You will likely perform actions other than these, such as\ncreating keys and assigning policies, by using the console.\n\n *   Encrypt \n   \n   \n *   Decrypt \n   \n   \n *   GenerateDataKey \n   \n   \n *   GenerateDataKeyWithoutPlaintext",
